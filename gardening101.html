    <!-- Our Garden Story -->
    <section id="garden-story">
        <h2>üå± Our Garden Story</h2>
        <p>We grow because it‚Äôs in our blood.</p>
        <p>Will grew up surrounded by monster gardens‚Äîhis grandpa sold pumpkins to the local community, and Will spent his childhood working on his uncle‚Äôs farm. Caleb has always loved plants and being part of the garden, and his family‚Äôs farm roots go back to Texas. Daniel has always had a love for plants too, but growing up in Reno‚Äôs high desert made it a lot harder to keep things alive.</p>
        <p>When the three of us first came together‚Äîeven just as friends‚Äîour garden adventure began in the smallest space: a little plot tucked between two driveways in La Mesa. But we made it work. Daniel overgrew his entire front yard, experimenting and growing anything he can.</p>
        <p>Now, life has leveled up. We own our home together and live full-blown garden life‚Äîwith six large raised beds, one big in-ground garden, and a growing collection of fruit trees. It‚Äôs become a true source of simple joy. And doing all of this right in our front yard in the inner city? It‚Äôs proof that anyone can grow their own food‚Äîanywhere.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôre here to share what we know and how we grow so you can do it at home too. Feed yourself, your family, and your friends. It‚Äôs possible. And it‚Äôs worth it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- How We Grow -->
    <section id="how-we-grow">
        <h2>üåø How We Grow</h2>
        <p>Living in Southern California, we‚Äôve had to get creative with our garden. Our yard is full of hard, compacted clay soil that can barely grow grass‚Äîso raised beds were the move. We invested in high-quality raised beds with a 20-year warranty. They‚Äôre not a sponsor, but we love Vego Garden beds‚Äîthey have a layer of foam between the walls that helps keep plant roots cooler, unlike those thin metal bins from the big box stores that can heat up fast.</p>

        <p>When you‚Äôre thinking about starting a garden, remember these three magic words:</p>
        <p>üå± Soil, ‚òÄÔ∏è Sun, üíß Water.</p>

        <p>üå± <strong>Soil</strong><br>
            Soil is everything. Sure, plants need sun and water, but if you don‚Äôt get the soil right, the whole thing falls apart. For us, soil is like science.
            We start with basic garden soil from the hardware store as the foundation. Then we mix in rich compost, and dirt straight from our chicken run. That combo builds living, nutrient-packed soil where plants just flourish.
        </p>

        <p>‚òÄÔ∏è <strong>Sun</strong><br>
            Your garden will need a ton of sun‚Äîat least 7 hours of full sun a day to really produce, especially for fruits and veggies.
            In the hottest parts of summer, our garden actually benefits from a little afternoon shade thanks to two big palm trees. This helps when temps hit 117¬∞F because most plants stop growing over 90¬∞F. Photosynthesis slows way down in extreme heat, and shade can save your harvest.
        </p>

        <p>üíß <strong>Water</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seedlings: Just need to stay damp.</li>
            <li>Big plants (like pumpkins or corn): It‚Äôs time to WATER.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While it‚Äôs possible to overwater, we find that most people actually don‚Äôt water enough, especially with heavy feeders.</p>
        <p>We group our garden into watering zones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Corn, Watermelon, and Pumpkins: These love water and share the same heavy-watering zone.</li>
            <li>Peppers and Flowers: These are in a lighter-watering zone since they prefer to dry out a bit between drinks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Watching each plant and adjusting based on their needs is key. Trust us‚Äîplants will tell you when they‚Äôre thirsty.</p>

    <!-- Miracle-Gro Section -->
    <section id="miracle-gro">
        <h2>üö´ Why We Don‚Äôt Use Miracle-Gro</h2>
        <p>STOP! We don‚Äôt use Miracle-Gro in our garden‚Äîand here‚Äôs why.</p>
        <p>If it‚Äôs a plant we aren‚Äôt going to eat (like our bamboo, tropicals, plumerias, houseplants, etc.)‚Äîsure, Miracle-Gro it up. But when it comes to food? No thanks.</p>
        <p>We want our garden to be cleaner than most, and that‚Äôs why we skip Miracle-Gro and use MaxiGro instead.</p>
        <h3>How We Found MaxiGro</h3>
        <p>We discovered MaxiGro when Caleb‚Äôs brother was in plant school here in California. He had leftover hydroponic water, and we figured, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try it.‚Äù Even after it was ‚Äúused up,‚Äù it made our plants explode with growth.</p>
        <p>So we did some digging and found out MaxiGro is actually way better than Miracle-Gro‚Äîand you don‚Äôt even need to use it all season.</p>
        <p>We feed our garden with MaxiGro for the first 4 to 6 weeks and then just let it grow naturally.</p>
        <p>Exception? Our pumpkins. Since we don‚Äôt eat them, we MaxiGro those bad boys all summer long‚Äîbecause pumpkins LOVE food, and we LOVE pumpkins. üéÉ</p>
        <h3>üåø MaxiGro vs. Miracle-Gro: Quick Comparison</h3>
        <p><strong>‚úÖ Why We Prefer MaxiGro:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No Urea Nitrogen: Uses nitrate-based nitrogen, which is safer and doesn‚Äôt burn plants or hurt your soil‚Äôs microbiome.</li>
            <li>Hydroponic-Grade Purity: Clean, precise nutrients with fewer fillers.</li>
            <li>Better Mineral Balance: Less salt buildup over time compared to cheaper fertilizers.</li>
            <li>Transparent Ingredients: Trusted by food growers who care about what‚Äôs going into their soil.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>üö´ Miracle-Gro Concerns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains Urea Nitrogen: Can leach into groundwater and damage beneficial soil life.</li>
            <li>High Salt Content: Leads to salt buildup that‚Äôs tough on long-term gardens.</li>
            <li>Fast Visual Growth, Not Soil Health: Great for show plants, not the best for nutrient-dense food.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>üí° Bottom Line:</strong> If you care about what you‚Äôre feeding yourself, your family, and your garden‚ÄîMaxiGro is the better choice. It‚Äôs not 100% organic, but it‚Äôs way more aligned with mindful, sustainable gardening than Miracle-Gro. You don‚Äôt need to use it forever‚Äîjust enough to get your garden going.</p>

    <!-- Our Goal Section -->
    <section id="our-goal">
        <h2>üå± Our Goal</h2>
        <p>Our goal is simple ‚Äî we want to help you succeed at gardening right at home.</p>
        <p>Growing your own food can save you money, help you eat better, boost your mental health (there‚Äôs just something magical about getting your hands in the dirt), and honestly, it‚Äôs a lot of fun to learn along the way.</p>
        <p>Right now, we grow a ton of things:
            üå∏ Flowers, üçã Citrus Trees, üéÉ Pumpkins, üçâ Watermelon, üå± Radishes, üå∂Ô∏è Jalape√±os, ü´ë Green & Red Bell Peppers, üßÖ Onions, üåø Basil, üåø Fennel, üåø Dill, üåΩ Sweet Corn, üçì Strawberries, ü´ê Blackberries, üå± Artichokes, ü•ï Carrots, üßÑ Garlic, üåµ Dragon Fruit, üçç Pineapples, üçá Grapes, üå± Chives, ü•î Potatoes, üå± Beans, üçÖ Tomatoes, and üå± Parsley.
        </p>

        <p>But until we finish filling in all those plant guides, our Garden Wizard is here to help you grow! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ask the Wizard anything‚Äîbig questions, tiny questions, or ‚Äúwhat is this weird bug?‚Äù questions. The Garden Wizard has your back.</p>
        <p>We love plants ‚Äî like, it‚Äôs a full-blown obsession. Honestly, if we leave Lowe‚Äôs without a new plant, it‚Äôs a major accomplishment. We want you to feel that same excitement when it comes to your garden ‚Äî and we‚Äôre here to help you get there. üåøüíö</p>
