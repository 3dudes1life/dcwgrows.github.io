        <h2>🌱 Our Garden Story</h2>
        <p>
            We grow because it’s in our blood.<br><br>

            Will grew up surrounded by monster gardens—his grandpa sold pumpkins to the local community, and Will spent his childhood working on his uncle’s farm. Caleb has always loved plants and being part of the garden, and his family’s farm roots go back to Texas. Daniel has always had a love for plants too, but growing up in Reno’s high desert made it a lot harder to keep things alive.<br><br>

            When the three of us first came together—even just as friends—our garden adventure began in the smallest space: a little plot tucked between two driveways in La Mesa. But we made it work. Daniel overgrew his entire front yard, experimenting and growing anything he can.<br><br>

            Now, life has leveled up. We own our home together and live full-blown garden life—with six large raised beds, one big in-ground garden, and a growing collection of fruit trees. It’s become a true source of simple joy. And doing all of this right in our front yard in the inner city? It’s proof that anyone can grow their own food—anywhere.<br><br>

            We’re here to share what we know and how we grow so you can do it at home too. Feed yourself, your family, and your friends. It’s possible. And it’s worth it.

        <h2>🌿 How We Grow</h2>
        <p>
            Living in Southern California, we’ve had to get creative with our garden. Our yard is full of hard, compacted clay soil that can barely grow grass—so raised beds were the move. We invested in high-quality raised beds with a 20-year warranty. They’re not a sponsor, but we love Vego Garden beds—they have a layer of foam between the walls that helps keep plant roots cooler, unlike those thin metal bins from the big box stores that can heat up fast.<br><br>

            When you’re thinking about starting a garden, remember these three magic words:<br><br>
            🌱 Soil, ☀️ Sun, 💧 Water.
        </p>

        <h3>🌱 Soil</h3>
        <p>
            Soil is everything. Sure, plants need sun and water, but if you don’t get the soil right, the whole thing falls apart. For us, soil is like science.<br><br>

            We start with basic garden soil from the hardware store as the foundation. Then we mix in rich compost, and dirt straight from our chicken run. That combo builds living, nutrient-packed soil where plants just flourish.
        </p>

        <h3>☀️ Sun</h3>
        <p>
            Your garden will need a ton of sun—at least 7 hours of full sun a day to really produce, especially for fruits and veggies.<br><br>

            In the hottest parts of summer, our garden actually benefits from a little afternoon shade thanks to two big palm trees. This helps when temps hit 117°F because most plants stop growing over 90°F. Photosynthesis slows way down in extreme heat, and shade can save your harvest.
        </p>

        <h3>💧 Water</h3>
        <p>
            Watering will ramp up as your plants grow.<br><br>

            • Seedlings: Just need to stay damp.<br><br>
            • Big plants (like pumpkins or corn): It’s time to WATER.<br><br>

            While it’s possible to overwater, we find that most people actually don’t water enough, especially with heavy feeders.
        </p>

        <p>
            We group our garden into watering zones:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Corn, Watermelon, and Pumpkins: These love water and share the same heavy-watering zone.</li>
            <li>Peppers and Flowers: These are in a lighter-watering zone since they prefer to dry out a bit between drinks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Watching each plant and adjusting based on their needs is key. Trust us—plants will tell you when they’re thirsty.
        </p>

        <h2>Watering Wisely</h2>
        <p>
            More plants die from overwatering than underwatering.<br><br>
            Let the soil dry out a bit between watering, especially for succulents.<br><br>
            Stick your finger in the soil — if it feels dry a couple inches down, it’s time to water.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Trimming & Propagation</h2>
        <p>
            Don’t be afraid to trim!<br><br>
            Many plants thrive when you cut back dead leaves or flowers.<br><br>
            Plus, some plants (like succulents) grow super easily from cuttings.
